## üìä Crisis Classification

Based on the [UK Government Crisis Communications Operating Model](https://www.communications.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Crisis-Communications-Operating-Model.pdf), crises are classified into three levels:

### Level 1: Significant Emergency
- **Impact:** Localized incident affecting specific departments or regions
- **Response time:** < 2 hours
- **Coordination:** Departmental level
- **Examples:** Local service disruption, minor data breach, isolated severe weather impact

### Level 2: Serious Emergency
- **Impact:** Regional or multi-departmental impact requiring coordinated response
- **Response time:** < 1 hour
- **Coordination:** Cross-departmental with executive awareness
- **Examples:** Major cybersecurity incident, significant operational failure, reputational attack

### Level 3: Catastrophic Emergency
- **Impact:** Organization-wide or national-level crisis
- **Response time:** < 30 minutes
- **Coordination:** Executive-led crisis team with full organizational mobilization
- **Examples:** Global pandemic, major leadership crisis, catastrophic system failure

## üö® Crisis Types & Response Playbooks

### 1. Cybersecurity Incident
**Common scenarios:** Data breach, ransomware attack, system compromise, DDoS attack

**Key considerations:**
- Legal and regulatory obligations (GDPR, data protection laws)
- Customer data exposure risk
- Service continuity impact
- Coordination with IT, legal, and regulatory teams

**Initial response priorities:**
1. Contain the incident (IT-led)
2. Assess data exposure scope
3. Notify regulatory authorities (if required by law)
4. Prepare holding statement
5. Monitor social/media for misinformation

**Communication approach:**
- Transparency within legal constraints
- Focus on actions being taken
- Clear timelines for updates
- Dedicated incident response page

---

### 2. Public Health Emergency
**Common scenarios:** Pandemic, outbreak affecting operations, health and safety incident

**Key considerations:**

**Initial response priorities:**
1. Activate business continuity protocols
2. Align messaging with public health authorities
3. Communicate safety measures to employees
4. Update customers on service impacts
5. Monitor for misinformation about organizational response

**Communication approach:**
- Empathy and care-first messaging
- Clear, factual information
- Regular updates on safety measures
- Support resources for affected stakeholders

---

### 3. Severe Weather / Natural Disaster
**Common scenarios:** Hurricanes, floods, extreme weather events impacting operations

**Key considerations:**
- Employee and customer safety

---

### 4. Reputational Crisis
**Common scenarios:** Misinformation campaigns, coordinated negative attacks, viral negative content, brand hijacking

**Key considerations:**
- Speed of spread (especially on social media)
- Fact vs. fiction assessment
- Amplification risk
- Long-term brand impact

**Initial response priorities:**
1. Verify facts immediately
2. Assess sentiment and spread velocity
3. Identify inorganic activity (bots, coordinated campaigns)
4. Prepare fact-based response
5. Monitor all channels continuously

**Communication approach:**
- Rapid response (minutes, not hours)
- Fact-correction with evidence
- Avoid amplifying false narratives
- Direct engagement when appropriate
- Consider when silence is strategic

---

### 5. Service/Operations Disruption
**Common scenarios:** System outages, supply chain failures, major service interruptions

**Key considerations:**
- Customer impact scope
- Service restoration timeline
- Compensation/resolution approach
- Regulatory reporting requirements

**Initial response priorities:**
1. Acknowledge the issue immediately
2. Provide known information
3. Set expectations for updates
4. Coordinate with operations team
5. Monitor customer sentiment

**Communication approach:**
- Acknowledge, apologize, act
- Transparency about timeline
- Regular updates (even if "no new information")
- Clear restoration milestones
- Post-incident follow-up

---

### 6. Leadership & Executive Crisis
**Common scenarios:** Executive death/serious incident, legal investigations, misconduct allegations, succession crises

**Key considerations:**
- Legal implications and restrictions
- Employee morale and uncertainty
- Market/investor confidence (if public company)
- Media pressure intensity
- Family/personal privacy
- Regulatory obligations

**Initial response priorities:**
1. Coordinate with legal counsel immediately
2. Assess what can/cannot be communicated legally
3. Prepare internal communication first (employees before external)
4. Brief board/senior leadership
5. Designate authorized spokesperson
6. Monitor for speculation and misinformation

**Communication approach:**
- Extreme sensitivity and respect
- Legal review of all statements
- Tiered communication (internal ‚Üí investors ‚Üí public)
- Limited, factual information only
- "We cannot comment on ongoing investigations" when appropriate
- Demonstrate organizational stability and continuity

**Special considerations:**
- **Death/bereavement:** Compassion first, operational continuity second
- **Legal investigations:** Coordinate with legal team, respect presumption of innocence
- **Misconduct allegations:** Balance transparency with fair process
- **Succession crisis:** Reassure stakeholders of continuity and governance

- Volume spike alerts

**Red Flags:**
- Sudden volume increase (>200% normal baseline)

- Inorganic activity patterns (bot networks)
- Coordinated messaging
- Verified account amplification
- Mainstream media pickup of social narrative

### Alert Thresholds

**Tier 1 - Monitor:** Elevated activity, no immediate action
**Tier 2 - Notify:** Brief crisis team, prepare holding statements
**Tier 3 - Activate:** Immediate response required
