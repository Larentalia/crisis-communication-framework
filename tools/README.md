## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Customization Options

**Sentiment categories:** Modify to match your classification
```python
# In sentiment_analyzer.py
SENTIMENT_COLORS = {
    'Positive': '#2ecc71',
    'Neutral': '#95a5a6', 
    'Negative': '#e74c3c'
}
```

**Spike detection threshold:** Adjust sensitivity
```python
# Default: 2x average = spike
spikes = analyzer.identify_spikes(threshold_multiplier=2.0)

# More sensitive: 1.5x average
spikes = analyzer.identify_spikes(threshold_multiplier=1.5)
```

**Report styling:** Modify colors, fonts, layout in each script

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"File not found" error:**
- Ensure CSV file path is correct
- Use absolute paths if relative paths don't work

**Dates not parsing:**
- Ensure date format is YYYY-MM-DD
- Check for empty date cells

**Missing sentiment values:**
- All records must have Positive, Neutral, or Negative sentiment
- Check for typos in sentiment column

**Empty plots:**
- Verify data file has content
- Check date range is correct

---

## üìà Best Practices

### Data Collection
- **Consistency:** Use same categories throughout crisis
- **Timeliness:** Update data at regular intervals
- **Completeness:** Don't skip sentiment classification
- **Verification:** Double-check URLs and sources

### Reporting
- **Daily cadence:** Generate reports at same time each day
- **Clear naming:** Use date in filename (e.g., `report_2024-01-15.pdf`)
- **Archive:** Keep all reports for post-crisis analysis
- **Distribution:** Define who receives reports and when
